          Interface Polymorphism Version 1.00 Beta Release 1

                              2000/10/06

This is the first (rough) release of a pair of pragmata to do Perl6
RFC265 style interface polymorphism in Perl 5. The Changes file
details any changes made since the pre beta code. This is reasonably
fully featured code and should be reliable and not overly painful to
use since it does most of its magic at compile time and cleans up
after itself. Which is nice.

Installation is the usual dance of:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Documentation is *very* rough, but will get better, I promise.
Eventually.

Any errors, inaccuracies or omissions are bugs and should be reported
to the author, who only wrote this thing for a laugh really.

Enjoy this, I hope it's useful; it got written to scratch an itch.
